1,"Tim, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where do you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand as we enter a new iPhone cycle?",iPhone replacement,"Yes. Hi, Eric. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter, and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency and the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14, and so that’s kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it’s very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we’re going to provide to users, and we believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.",10.5,0,124,105,High,
2,"Okay, that’s very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then, second to that, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency. An improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare, you know, that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole, how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward?",China dynamics,"Yeah, Eric, as you point out, we decreased by six and a half percent year over year for the whole of greater China, and if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than three. So over 50 percent of the decline year over year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year and so we’re happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders and so that’s a very strong signal, and in fact, the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Also, one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to September of ’23. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14, and so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one of the things that we’re very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products, and so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in mainland China the majority of customers buying are buying that product for the first time, and the Watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying the product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also, that iPad returned to growth in greater China as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China.",6.7,2,286,107,High,
3,"Hey, Tim, now that you’ve launched or announced Apple Intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it might impact services? Do you feel like it’ll accelerate your services business, augment it, and maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things? How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for services in the next year?",AI services impact,"You know, we started the roll-out of Apple Intelligence this week with developers. So, some of the features are out there as of Monday, and we couldn’t be more excited about getting them out there. Obviously, this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level, and so we’re taking this first step in getting the beta out there, and we can’t wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.",2.6,1,76,46,Low,
4,I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you’ve seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence-enabled phones.,iPhone 15 Pro demand,"You know, we just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June, and so we had very limited time during the quarter. So, it’s really too early to tell.",1.4,1,36,34,Low,
5,"That’s fair, and then, you know, with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you’re expecting from the U.S. promotional environment from your channel partners, U.S. wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle, or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period.",U.S. promotions,"You know, we are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it’s another compelling reason for an upgrade. I’d leave the promotional question for the carriers themselves to answer, but I believe it will be a very key time and a compelling upgrade cycle.",3.6,1,47,56,Low,
6,"Tim, maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic. There’s really a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you just touch on, do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers, or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?",AI feature rollout,"The rollout, as we mentioned in June, we’ve actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond U.S. English that will happen over the course of the year, and there are other features that will happen over the course of the year, and ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. And so, yes, so it is a staggered launch.",4.1,1,78,61,Medium,
7,"Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners, but they’re leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long term, do you see the services growth from Apple Intelligence being the largest contributor over time or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time?",AI monetization,"You know, the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the Private Cloud Compute, and a lot of that will be things with a personal context, and then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially, and that will be focused on world knowledge, as I said. And so the monetization model, I don’t want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they’re confidential between the parties. But I see both aspects as being very important. People want both.",1.2,1,91,32,Low,
8,"Krish Sankar, TD Cowen: We keep hearing about this increasing silicon content for AI edge devices. And also, I think Luca, you spoke about increasing commodity costs. So I’m curious how to think about margin for these new AI devices, and Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today?",Hardware requirements,"Maybe I’ll take the second one first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so, from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products, obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020, and the iPad is the same, and so it starts with the M-series of silicon. And so, there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.",1.4,0,104,14,Low,
